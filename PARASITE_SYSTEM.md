# Parasite System

This mechanic introduces special parasite items that monsters occasionally carry.
They occupy a consumable slot but cannot be used directly. Simply holding the
item grants a small stat bonus, but comes with drawbacks.

- Monsters have around a 15% chance to spawn with a random parasite.
- Parasites can be equipped by mercenaries in a consumable slot.
- Carriers lose fullness twice as fast and gain affinity at half the normal rate.
- Experience gained is reduced by 20% while a parasite is equipped.

In future updates parasites of the same type will be combinable to raise their
rank, increasing the stat bonuses they provide.
